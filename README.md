# Steps to Fix the Error: could not find the output directory with the static assets Or any other error related to missing a static directory

 ## This error happens because DigitalOcean cannot find a folder to build your app. This can occur if you added a .yaml file (as in my case) or for other reasons that prevent DigitalOcean from locating your files and deploying your app or static website.

### 1 - Create a Folder for Static Files
At the root of your project, create a folder named one of the following:
- _static
- dist
- public
- build

### 2 - Move Your Application Files
Your application likely has a folder containing all necessary files, typically named app or application. Simply copy this folder into the directory you created in Step 1.

### 3 - If You're Using a Framework
If your project is built using a framework, you need to create a file called app.yaml.
```yaml
static_sites:
  - name: frontend
    output_dir: public
    routes:
      - path: /
```
#### 3.1 - Define the Output Directory in app.yaml
Make sure the output_dir field contains the exact name of the folder you created in Step 1.

#### 3.2 - Notify DigitalOcean About the app.yaml File
Just creating the app.yaml file is not enough. You must notify DigitalOcean that the file exists.
If you haven't installed the DigitalOcean CLI (doctl), follow the guide:

</div>

Log in to DigitalOcean

```
doctl auth init
```

Apply the app.yaml Configuration

```
doctl apps update <APP_ID> --spec app.yaml
```

Find Your <APP_ID>
```
https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/your_app_id
```

### Commit and Rebuild Your App
After making these changes, commit your modifications and trigger a new build for your application.
